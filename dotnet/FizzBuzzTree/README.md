# Code Challenge 18
This challenge showcases the traversal of K-ary trees. K-ary trees are tree structures in which child nodes can only have up to k children, in this challenge we must traverse a k-nary tree and change it's node's values.
## Challenge
Your function should tWrite a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.ake a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.
